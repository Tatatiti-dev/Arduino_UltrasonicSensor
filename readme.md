## Arduino UltrasonicSensor library for HC-SR04
This is a library for na HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. It is compatible with any Arduino board. It uses two digital pins for Trigger and Echo of the sensor.
### Features
This library can read the distance from the sensor, return last measured value and it always returns the distance in centimeters. It can also compute an average value of more measures by function readAverageDistance. A distance read by this way is also stored in the variable.
### Compatible boards (tested)
 - Arduino Uno
 - Arduino Leonardo
 - Arduino Nano
 - Arduino Mega 2560
 - Arduino Micro
#### Untested, but probably compatible boards
 - Arduino Due
 - Arduino Pro Mini
 - Arduino Mini
 - Arduino Lilypad
